# DND5E-Character-sheet
Hey, this is my attempt at an automated character sheet generator, it's a hobby of mine so feel free to use it for any personal games, if you want to use it for a professional use that's totally fine, but please let me know (as I'd love to see how it works out!) and please don't take credit, not that it's amazing and I'm pretty sure I have it hidden, but hey, oh well.

Basically all this does is streamlines the character creation process into a couple questions for players who already know the game, or walks through the character creation process for new players and tries to make it as easy on them as possible.  It's still a work in progress and I am aware that I need to add the following;
spells
feats
skills
languages
racial traits and stat adjustments
What I'm not concerned about adding, at least for the time being, is anything outside of the official players handbook as that goes beyond my inital project scope and honestly, it's my first project so I want to keep it somewhat simplistic for my own sanity.  Also, I really want a Redbull.  That has nothing to do with the file but I'm tired and want to go to bed but I have more to do tonight so I suppose I'll just power through without one as I'm really not wanting to go to the grocery store.... but I'm almost out of food.... craaaaap.  Oh this has nothing to do with the program anymore, I'm just plotting out my night now, maybe tomorrow after work I'll go to the store, but who am I kidding, I'm going to wait until I have nothing in my fridge then rush out one night after work like any normal human.  Anyway, if you're still reading, thanks, and let me know of any changes you'd make! - L
